# Hexapod
As senior Mechatronics Engineering students, we are required to fully design and implement a graduation project. We chose to make, as our project, a real life Hexapod Robot using raspberry pi, wirelessly controlled by a mobile app we fully developped. Basically, a hexapod is an 18 DOF six-legged robot. A hexapod has a lot of advantages against wheeled robots. However, the number one benefit that hexapod robots have ahead of wheeled robots is walking on rough terrains. For this solely reason, we chose to design a cargo hexapod that helps to carry luggage for military troops. Moreover, it is critical to incorporate the dynamic model in the design of the control algorithm and motion simulation to be able to control a robot manipulator as required by its operation.
